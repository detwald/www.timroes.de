title: About Me
---

My name is Tim Roes and I am a computer scientist and Android & web enthusiast from Karlsruhe, Germany.

In 2013, I graduated from Karlsruhe University of Applied Science with a Masterâ€™s degree in computer science.

I am working in the application development department of [inovex](http://www.inovex.de/?utm_source=Tim%20Roes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Tim%20Roes_About%20Me) in Karlsruhe. You can also find several of my colleagues blogging on our [company blog](https://blog.inovex.de). We are an IT service provider, so you can contact us for professional services for most of the topics I am writing about on my blog (and many more).

You can contact me via [mail](mailto:mail@timroes.de) or [Jabber/XMPP](xmpp:tim.roes@jabber.werosys.de) or just drop me a note in one of the social networks.
