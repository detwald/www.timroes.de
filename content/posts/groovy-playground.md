For all of you who just want to test some small scripts in [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/)
without needing to start up an idea or you are just learning the language and want
to have an easy way to test what you try, I created the Groovy Playground:

[Groovy Playground online](biglink:https://groovy-playground.appspot.com/)

It is an easy web console, that let you enter Groovy code and execute it online.
That way you can see if your scripts does what you expect them to do or just
play around with Groovy. You can also hover over the output of your script to
see what line in the code generated that output.

The sources can be found in the [GitHub project](https://github.com/timroes/groovyplayground), where you can also find a
list of open issues. If you find any issues or have feature requests please feel
free to open an issue for it on GitHub.

The playground is hosted on Google's AppEngine and uses
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) for its frontend.
